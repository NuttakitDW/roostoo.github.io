# Introducing Roostoo Token Initiative (RSTO) 

**Effective Date: May 2, 2020**

Over the past few months, Roostoo has launched our long-awaited product – Mock Crypto Trading App. Since the launch, we have partnered with university clubs and faculty worldwide to host their branded mock crypto trading competitions, as a risk-free and creative introduction for students onboarding to the world of cryptocurrencies.

As we see more passionate users mock trading real-time on the Roostoo simulated exchange platform, we decide to roll out an exciting initiative --- **RSTO** --- that will progressively underpin the backbone of the Roostoo ecosystem.

## Roostoo Token (RSTO) 

RSTO will be the native game token for the Roostoo app. The ideal vision for RSTO is to become an actual crypto token that drives the value of the Roostoo community and Roostoo product. 

The primary function of RSTO is to reward good mock traders on Roostoo. We decide to start with a simple mechanism: 

1.	Roostoo will airdrop 50 RSTO per user. 
2.	Roostoo will be launching regular competitions (1-day, 3-day, 7-day, etc.) on the app. 
3.	Users will need to pay RSTO to join each Roostoo-held competition. 
4.	After a competition ends, RSTO will be distributed back to users according to their ranking on the leaderboard. 
5.	High-rank users will receive more RSTO, thus making a higher return. Low-rank users will also receive RSTO, but less than what they pay to join the competition initially. 

## RSTO Distribution Rules

#### Total Pool Distribution

Users in each Roostoo regular competition will be divided into different tiers according to their final ranking. Each tier will share a portion of the total RSTO pooled from all users who joined the competition:

* Tier 1 (*Ranked Top 10%*) : 25% of Pool
* Tier 2 (*Ranked 11% – 30%*) : 25% of Pool
* Tier 3 (*Ranked 31% – 60%*) : 20% of Pool
* Tier 4 (*Ranked 61% – 100%*) : 10% of Pool
* Bonus Pool (*For top 10 users*) : 9.5% of Pool
* Commission Burn : 10.5% of Pool


#### Bonus Pool Distribution

A bonus pool is set up to reward top 10 users who share 9.5% of Pool: 

* 1st place: 3% of Pool
* 2nd place: 2% of Pool
* 3rd place: 1% of Pool
* 4th--10th place: 0.5% of Pool each


## Example

The following is an example of a 7-day regular competition payout scheme. 

Assume there are 100 participants, each user is required to pay 20 RSTO to join. The total pool is 100 × 20 = 2000 RSTO. 

This will be the payout scheme distributing the pool (2000 RSTO) to each ranking tier:

|Tier (Ranking) 	|% Pool Distribution for Tier	|RSTO
|--- |--- |--- |
|Top 10%	                    |25% of Pool	    |500
|11%--30% 	                    |25% of Pool	    |500
|31%--60%	                    |20% of Pool	    |400
|61%--100%	                    |10% of Pool	    |200
|Bonus Pool (for top 10 user)	|9.5% of Pool	    |190
|Commission Burn	            |10.5% of Pool	    |210


If you join a 7-day regular competition of 100 participants, this will be your payout (depending on which tier you fall into) after the competition ends:

|Tier (Ranking) |Pool RSTO for Tier |No. of Users	|Payout per User	|Paid-In per User 	|Profit 	|% Return 
|--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |
|Top 10%    |500 RSTO   |10	|+50 RSTO	    |-20  RSTO	|+30	    |150%
|11%--30% 	|500 RSTO	|20	|+25 RSTO	    |-20  RSTO	|+5	    |25%
|31%--60%	|400 RSTO	|30	|+13.33  RSTO	|-20  RSTO	|-6.67	|-33%
|61%--100%	|200 RSTO	|40	|+5  RSTO	    |-20  RSTO	|-15	    |-75%

If you are skillful and make it to the top 10 on the leaderboard, you enjoy extra bonus RSTO:

|Ranking 	|Bonus (% from pool)	|Bonus Payout	|Total Payout	|Paid-In Cost	|% Return
|--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |
|1st	        |3%      |+60 RSTO	|+110 RSTO |-20 RSTO	|450%
|2nd	        |2%      |+40 RSTO	|+90 RSTO |-20 RSTO	|350%
|3rd	        |1%      |+20 RSTO	|+70 RSTO |-20 RSTO	|250%
|4th--10th	    |0.5%	 |+10 RSTO	|+60 RSTO |-20 RSTO	|200%
 


## Ways to acquire RSTO

1. **Initial Airdrop**: Every user account will obtain 50 RSTO to start. 

2. **Join regular competitions**: Regular competitions are designed to reward Roostoo users whose trade performances are above average compared to others. 

3. **Daily rewards\***: For users who do not perform comparatively well in consecutive competitions and thus losing on RSTO, you will still be able to accumulate RSTO by claiming daily reward every day if you use the app. 

    \* *Diminishing Daily Rewards Scheme*
    
    - For the first 20 days of usage, users will receive 5 RSTO/day (100 RSTO available). 

    - For the next 30 days of usage, users will receive 4 RSTO/day (120 RSTO available). 

    - For the next 50 days of usage, users will receive 3 RSTO/day (150 RSTO available). 

    - From that onward, users will receive 1 RSTO/day.  

## Conclusion

Roostoo attempts to create a [payout scheme](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UsC53Y-gJJJat_cA2pYqCKXwcjUNNItO_Az8UPPjR-g/edit?usp=sharing) that is fair and meritocratic. For users who do not perform comparatively well in consecutive competitions and thus losing on RSTO, you will still be able to accumulate RSTO by claiming daily reward every day you use the app.
